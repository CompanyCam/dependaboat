      ## Summary
      
      A security vulnerability of severity **{{alert_severity}}** has been found in {{alert_package_name}} ({{alert_package_ecosystem}}). The full details
      are contained in the [Dependabot alert](https://github.com/YourOrgName/your-great-repo/security/dependabot/{{alert_number}}).
      
      ## Next Steps
      
      ### 1. Confirm the vulnerability.
      Verify that we are vulnerable to the reported issue. If we are not, close the dependabot alert with a comment explaining why. Then, you will need
      to also close _this_ issue with a comment explaining why.
      
      ### 2. Confirm the severity.
      If there is reason to adjust the reported severity, do so and make a comment in this issue indicating the reasoning.
      
      ### 3. Remediate the issue by the deadline.
      Update the package to a non-vulnerable version or apply patches to prevent the vulnerability from affecting us. (Be sure to reference this issue number in your PRs!)
